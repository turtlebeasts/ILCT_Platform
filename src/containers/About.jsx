                            Welcome to our Interactive Live Coding & Teaching Platform! Our mission is to revolutionize the way coding is taught and learned by creating an engaging, collaborative, and interactive educational experience.

                            In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, traditional teaching methods can often fall short in keeping students engaged and providing real-time feedback. Our platform, built using Node.js and socket programming, aims to bridge this gap by allowing teachers to demonstrate coding in real-time. Students can observe the code as it is written, interact with the instructor, and even request permission to modify the code themselves, creating a dynamic and hands-on learning environment.
